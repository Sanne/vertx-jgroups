# Test

In order to have the unit tests running, run the following command:

 ```
 mvn clean install -Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true
 ```

Remember, it's suggested to use IPv4, to do so specify the **java.net.preferIPv4Stack** parameter.

Important: check your network configuration to be sure that there's no firewall.
